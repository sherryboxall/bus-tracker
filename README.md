# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description 
This project displays a web page containing real time location information for a bus route from MIT to Harvard. It is used to showcase my ability to write async functions to fetch data from external sources. This project also makes use of programmatic styling to build and render a map on a web page.

## How to Run 
Download the HTML, CSS, image, and Javascript files. You will also need to request and get your own api key from the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority. Drag and drop onto your browser

## Future Improvements 
Future improvements could include a user interface to select a different city or bus route.
